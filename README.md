## 🚧 Beta Alert! 🚧

⚠️ **Warning: Wild Beta in Progress!** ⚠️

This project is currently in beta, which means:
- Things might break (but in a fun way!)
- Features are like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're gonna get
- We're adding new stuff faster than we can document it
- Your feedback helps us fix things we didn't know were broken 🔧
- Sometimes it works so well it scares us

But hey, that's what makes it exciting, right? Join us on this wild adventure of making Swift development on Windows actually work! 🎢

## 🚀 What's This All About?

Hey there! Welcome to AirFlight - a totally fun (and slightly chaotic) IDE for Swift development on Windows. Born out of frustration and fueled by caffeine, this project aims to make Swift development on Windows less of a headache and more of an adventure!

### ✨ Features That Actually Work

- **Swift Compilation** - Yes, you can actually compile Swift code on Windows! 🎉
- **Dynamic Island Notifications** - Because we're fancy like that 💅
- **Project Management** - Keep your stuff organized(ish)
- **Native-like Experience** - It's like macOS, but with a Windows twist 🌪️
- **Build Tools** - For when you actually want to run your code

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

1. Download the latest release
2. Install it (you know, the usual next-next-finish dance 💃)
3. Fire it up and start coding!

```bash
# That's literally it. No complicated setup required!
```

## 🛠️ Development

Yes, there's spaghetti code. Yes, we know about it. No, we're not ashamed (okay, maybe a little).

- Sometimes it works perfectly (those moments are magical ✨)
- Sometimes it doesn't (those moments are... learning opportunities 📚)
- Features might appear or disappear like ninjas 🥷
- Bugs aren't bugs, they're surprise features waiting to be fixed
