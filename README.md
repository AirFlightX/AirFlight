# AirFlight
Let's be honest - this is a fun project made by developers who got tired of not having proper Swift tools on Windows. Yes, there's some spaghetti code inside üçù, but hey, it works! AirFlight brings you a modern, fast IDE with integrated terminal and native-like experience. 100% open-source and made with love for the Swift community.
