# 🤝 Contributing to AirFlight

First off, thanks for even thinking about contributing to our lovely mess! We're thrilled that you're here. Really. Like, really really! 🎉

## 🎯 Ground Rules

1. **Be Nice** - We're all here to have fun and make cool stuff
2. **No Judgment** - Yes, there's spaghetti code. We're working on it (kind of)
3. **Keep it Fun** - Life's too short for boring code

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### 1. Setting Up the Project

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/femboypig/airflight.git

# Enter the matrix
cd airflight

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or whatever package manager we're using this week
```

### 2. Making Changes

1. Create a branch with a fun name:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/make-it-awesome
# or
git checkout -b fix/oops-i-broke-it
```

2. Make your changes
3. Test your changes (yes, really!)
4. Commit with a fun message:
```bash
git commit -m "✨ Added more sparkles to the UI"
```

### 3. Code Style

- We use spaces, not tabs (unless you can convince us otherwise)
- Try to keep lines under 80 characters (but we won't judge if you don't)
- Comments are good. Funny comments are better
- If you write clean code, great! If you write more spaghetti code, also great! 🍝

### 4. Pull Request Process

1. Push your changes
2. Create a Pull Request
3. Wait for review (we're fast, usually)
4. Celebrate when it gets merged! 🎉
